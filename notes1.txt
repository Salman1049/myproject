- uptime -Uptime Command In Linux: It is used to find out how long the system is active (running). This command returns set of values that involve,
 the current time, and the amount of time system is in running state,
 number of users currently logged into, and the load time for the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes respectively.

- init 6 - In linux init 6 command basically used for reboot the system. It will restart the sysytem

- sudo apt update - it will  show update packages and new version of packages list held in our system .

- sudo apt upgrade - it will update the listing packages

- sudo apt install default-jdk :- install the latest java development kit

- sudo apt install default-jre :- install the java runtime environment

- apt-cache search application name :-it will list down all related packages with the application

- sudo apt autoremove

-sudo apt-get remove jenkins
sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove jenkins

1- adduser xyz - to create user

-> HostFiles
 - hostfile is the file where we can map hostname with ip address
 -All operating systems with network support have a hosts file to translate hostnames to IP addresses.
 -Whenever you open a website by typing its hostname, your system will read through the hosts file to check for the corresponding IP and then open it.
 -hostfile can be edited to override network settings
 -Basically hostfile is in /etc/hosts
 -Mapping hostnames to IP-addresses in /etc/hosts can be very useful for testing purposes.


-- command - sudo nano /etc/hosts

--> SWAP MEMORY

  
  -A Swap Memory is a space in the Hard Disk of your computer that Operating Systems will use to put the info,
  that is actually on the RAM to free it for another application.
  -Swap memory in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full.
  -If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.
  -Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.

--> SELINUX

 -Security-Enhanced Linux is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.
 -SELinux defines access controls for the applications, processes, and files on a system.
 - It uses security policies, which are a set of rules that tell SELinux what can or canâ€™t be accessed, to enforce the access allowed by a policy. 
 -When an application or process, known as a subject, makes a request to access an object, like a file,
  SELinux checks with an access vector cache (AVC), where permissions are cached for subjects and objects.
 -If SELinux is unable to make a decision about access based on the cached permissions, it sends the request to the security server.
 -The security server checks for the security context of the app or process and the file.
 -Security context is applied from the SELinux policy database.
 -Permission is then granted or denied. 

 -SELinux can run in one of three modes: disabled, permissive, or enforcing.
 -Disabled mode:-Disabled mode is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy,
 it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future.

 -Permissive mode:-In permissive mode, the system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs,
 but it does not actually deny any operations.While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development.

 -Enforcing mode:-Enforcing mode is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system.
